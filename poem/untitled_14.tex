Rape is a word\\
with more power\\
than any man can contain\\
Influence cities\\
Pestilence to a mind\\
a curse on a body\\
This abomination\\
is a word\\
More power than can\\
fit in any one person\\
This struggle to hold\\
we understand\\
but though we grasp
it, I plead you to\\
consider the power\\
that you grasp in your hands\\
Rape is a word.\\
