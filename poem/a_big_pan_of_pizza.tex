Big pan of pizza\\
One through eight\\
Each try is worse\\
Trying to drown my misery\\
Promising more math to myself\\
A counter; please short\\
As if I enjoy it\\
Waiting to be penetrated\\
Losing out to hunger\\
Bubbling hot with guilt\\
I'd wanna share if I could\\
But I have to count to eight\\
