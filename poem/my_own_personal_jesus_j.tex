My Own Personal Jesus J.

I write because yes,\\
it hurts inside\\
since I said sure\\
Deep devour my soul\\
and silly promises in the morn'.\\
I lied\\
Your music, yes, treats\\
me like that\\
- - -\\
I would follow you\\
to the ends of the earth\\
``just let me know''\\
I know it's hard to admit\\
But take me on your road,\\
in your knapsack\\
Or don't, I'll be there still\\
Because, Jesus\\
it hurts\\
And so I will follow you, Jesus J.\\
