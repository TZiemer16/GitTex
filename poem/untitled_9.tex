Corpse-grain springs from magic wounds\\
Healing blight for a payment of sun\\
When I'm back alive and my nightmare swoons\\
take harvest from life and pinch for fun\\

We don't joke with reanimators paradox\\
But appreciate vitality from each season\\
All hail master ticking clock\\
When I kill you, I'll die but I'm not done.\\
