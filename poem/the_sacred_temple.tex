My body is a temple\\
your mind is a pit\\
I'd fill every strip of it\\
with spires and crenellations\\

Hold onto your ugly\\
but I wish you could accept\\
that the blocks are heavy\\
and the woold old and creaking\\

I picture a drawing\\
where the lines fit perfectly\\
but it's a messy construction site\\
and I fear you will not know the sacred.\\
