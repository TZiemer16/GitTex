I am here on the high mountain\\
I have been here before\\

But each wind tendril\\
or missed songbird gasp\\
is a reminder\\

Of the time lying down.\\
Speaking not hearing.\\
Doing not being.\\
I am on the mountain.\\

The front porch steps God built.\\
The ascension from the valley\\
to up higher towards glory.\\
I am on the front porch steps.\\
