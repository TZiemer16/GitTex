Big Rubber Ball

This big rubber ball\\
Outside catastrophe\\
Latex protects\\
Sealents divide\\
Rolling in comfort\\
Rolling in style\\
Spin around my finger\\
`Till it crushes me\\
Play around like drums\\
See me roll healthy\\
See me bounce to sickness\\
Can't trap it, it's gone\\
Rolled on to another sinner\\
Too big for one woman\\
That's me, the recent sins\\
Sing `till the plastic\\
and the rubber\\
have choked out my voice\\
help me bounce\\
help me roll\\
until it settles again.\\
