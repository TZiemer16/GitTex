Big Poetry

The big man is evil\\
Factory words\\
Slimy-silky handshakes\\
Rhymes all the same\\
Grind to the top\\
Dash to the bottom\\
of the page\\
Grit and coffee moves\\
the machine side-to-side\\
Printing money\\
Enslaved writer-workers\\
10 dollars a word\\
But none good enough\\
Go faster, go harder\\
or even go faster\\
It doesn't matter\\
Big Poetry is evil.\\
