``The hard part is letting\\
people in'', they say.\\
My coffee sins are\\
easy targets.\\
These deranged words\\
ought to speak volumes\\
Loud to override your\\
capitulated idioms.\\
More power than\\
drugs and love.\\
Words explain hateful\\
thoughts and drown sad men.\\
Part of the process to\\
convert mothers milk\\
into funeral ashes.\\
I breath crime\\
and penance, just\\
ask my words.\\
