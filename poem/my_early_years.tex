Rusty rudder,\\
Inherited from mother,\\
Gray disposition,\\
That's my dad's position\\
Loyalty bred,\\
from backstab days\\
``Better off dead'',\\
I say, recovery from their haze\\
They plastered pink\\
across all my eyes\\
Forcing to drink\\
and feeding me lies\\
I'm fat enough,\\
and it's been tough\\
Leave me with my fears\\
Better off ignoring my tears.\\
