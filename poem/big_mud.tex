Sing with big muddy water \\
Emanating brown waves \\
Mucking up with bass \\
Crashing giant against unseen shores \\
Mixed up silt on clefs \\
And teardown trees with harmony \\
Making joy from ugly \\
Making friends with depth \\
Bragging about what is lost \\
Losing to criticism in the murk \\
Light pierces water \\
To create symphony \\
Bubbling CO2 to breathe the air \\
Breaking glass for the solo. \\
