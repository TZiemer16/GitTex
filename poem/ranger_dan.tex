Ranger Dan

Ranger Dan,\\
I'm in danger, Dan\\
Forest on fire\\
They see no smoke\\

Ranger Dan,\\
Find the master plan\\
A sould to steal\\
Ways to stay afloat\\

Ranger Dan,\\
Wrestle `em down with a pan\\
I got no utensils to heal this pain\\
There's reasons to call you\\

Ranger Dan,\\
I hit the flowers with a fan\\
Please know the signals\\
Flags and shouts for `em all\\
