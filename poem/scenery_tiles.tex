Two idle fairies\\
Grant me reminiscent thoughts\\
Patterned blue mosaics\\
that dot my eyesight\\
Like I stared at the sun too long\\
Designing a better rememberance\\
Are preaching:\\
-----calm\\
-----level\\
-----harmony\\
But are cold to the warmth\\
Though I waste not\\
-----and want not\\
pictured passions\\
dazzle me beyond\\
an ability to understand\\
as the human I am.\\
So I dance from place to place\\
Gazing and remembering\\
Forging new memories\\
in the tiles and the scenery,\\
wherever I may find them.\\
