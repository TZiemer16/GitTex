Oceans of Bigness and Blueness

Wailing waves\\
and taciturn textures\\
Each provoking their own harmonies\\
Drunk on salt and blue wine\\
My feet undertow\\
and head taking blows\\
Draping comfort sheets\\
Lilac-gray over my cheats\\
I mashed and mashed so brash\\
Struggling to stay afloat\\
Gracious sleep under the deep\\
and shipping rays\\
for which I pray\\
Destiny does call\\
like a punctured ball\\
Drowned and smothered\\
dragged down with the others\\
My heart is blue, and yours too\\
as soon as you grasp me\\
as soon as you name me\\
for I am this ocean so blue\\
