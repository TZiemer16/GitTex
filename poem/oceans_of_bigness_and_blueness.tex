Wailing waves,\\
taciturn entwined\\
Each provoking their own braves\\
Drunk on salt and blue wine\\
My feet undertow\\
and head taking blows\\
Draping comfort sheets\\
Lilac-gray over my cheeks\\
Smashing and mashing\\
so brash\\
whispers of sleep\\
under the deep\\
And wooden rays\\
for which I pray\\
Destiny does call\\
like a punctured ball\\
Drowned and smothered\\
dragged down with the others\\

My heart is blue, and yours too\\
as soon as you grasp me,\\
as soon as you name me.\\
for I am in this ocean so blue\\
