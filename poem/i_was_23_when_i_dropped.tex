In a social group\\
We were healthy and young\\
And comaradery\\
was our greatest strength\\

We wished a trip\\
Across the universe\\
Beyond our minds\\
And our house\\

But the devil inside us\\
Isn't always quiet\\
When we need it\\
It's not really our fault\\

But I was alone\\
with my own self\\
not because I was weak\\
But I discoverery that I was healthy\\

Just for the day\\
Two hours later\\
I was beyond coffee\\
and cake\\

My friends left\\
They were `good`\\
and then the burning ring\\
in my stomach alit\\

Now,\\
there are two things I hate\\
the Flu\\
and a Bad Trip\\

But close enough, I looked down\\
and commented\\
``Ugly``\\
On the starstruck rug\\

Primary colors are beautiful to me\\
The green on red and blue\\
Designs this was designed\\
for me\\

Not here\\
Not now\\
Please don't\\
The agency was scattered\\

Time to go\\
Time to go\\
This trip has taken off\\
Time to go\\

My shoes lifted me to the bathroom\\
Or someone's fridge\\
Or the local pool\\
I didn't really care\\

Even as constellations\\
Alit my lids\\
And slit my ears\\
To this new world order\\

I was imbibing\\
backwards air\\
Sliding through plumbing\\
A spaceship blasting off\\

When I became my sickness\\
A physical thing I doubted\\
I drew out the spigot\\
and became a goo monster\\

Terrorizing Tokyo\\
Or my house\\
With my demon friends\\
Spitting acid\\

The evel one I am\\
The womanizer\\
The racist\\
Who slings mud\\

A new convulsion\\
and I became the meek\\
Inheriting all earth\\
from Gods bathroom floor\\

A neptune fetus\\
Growing tendrils inwards\\
The roots prodded every orifice I had\\
and grew more\\

Fire shaped hair\\
A contract to my semicircle form\\
The hands bitten\\
To numb some pain\\

And my friends saved me\\
The crack of dawn zealot march\\
Slamming closets closed\\
Just to find me\\

Why they waited years\\
or were giants\\
I didn't know\\
but I was immediately alone again\\

Inside the beasts sacks\\
They promised aid\\
And whispered like dream fiends\\
I didn't trust the enemy\\

And again drowning this time\\
Towards and empty soul\\
Exhaling every auspice\\
I ever knew\\

I was a fifty\\
year old\\
stingray\\
Ready to fight\\

When they revealed me\\
To the dry world\\
The missing liquid inside me\\
Became my home\\

For just one second I was home again\\
Before they ripped open my chest\\
And gave me a heart attack\\
Or undid my saltwater form\\

Naked\\
alone\\
In a hospital\\
A bathroom floor lover\\

They sometimes\\
Sometimes creaked\\
Into my wardrobe\\
My home\\

New forms\\
Maybe objects\\
White demons\\
Much different\\

Every force feed\\
made me want\\
to become the fetus I had always been\\
the creature immune\\

Before the changes\\
Before the fixes\\
Before the healing\\
New to me\\

I was in a hospital\\
A bedside dry
A bed wet\\
My pool was real after all\\

I didn't get better\\
I was better\\
My own journey\\
Across the universe\\

And poured\\
Like a smoothie\\
Into my empty feet\\
Shins, hips\\

The crowns wept\\
White on white lights\\
My chains\\
Eventually loosened\\

My friends came back\\
From my home\\
And made me drink\\
From a cup they made\\

My lids drew closed\\
At night\\
It stayed black\\
I was just sleeping this time.\\
