Float, appreciate\\
Fly, commiserate\\
My song of the south\\
Settles on gold clouds\\

I own you for as far\\
as I'll ever see\\

This flesh bleeds cotton\\
And eyes of rubies\\
Scan horizons\\
Unknown for as long as I want\\
I can explore anything\\

I own you for as far\\
as I'll ever see\\

Ripped jeans and\\
Sequined ties\\
Flapping blue in\\
my expert tailwind\\
Ascend to heaven\\
and get lost in the sky\\

I own you for as far\\
as I'll ever see\\

Don't chart `till I'm done\\
Crazy circles dream in my mind\\
