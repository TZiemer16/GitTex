Stories always start out with a big first line.\\
Quotes are great because you can quote yourself and jerk yourself off.\\
You have to remember to toe the line, though.\\
Sentence fragments anger some people.\\
Cuss words aren't great for kids stories.\\
But honestly it doesn't even have to be good.\\
The word is reflective of who you are.\\
And all the rest is just how you make your pay.\\
