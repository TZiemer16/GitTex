This big rubber ball\\

Latex protects\\

Sealants divide\\

Saran-wrap clothes\\

with an air gap\\

and a globe moat\\

it rolls and bobs\\

on hills and rivers\\

down a path\\

pinball bounces\\

cruising in perfect style\\

like half a pair of cool shades\\

stay true\\

stay even\\

don't choke\\

don't puncture\\

until peace\\

until it settles again.\\
