Big Antlers

These signals are inopportune\\
Raise your head a different time\\
I don't need your emotion\\
Not now, something later\\

Your antlers cue envy\\
They cue me downtrodden\\
I love their fractals\\
But hate why you raise them\\

Your antlers are loud signals\\
Songs of mourning\\
Songs I disagree on\\
Bite an apple in the snow\\

Signal a change\\
I'm sick of these hates\\
Bring back smoother heads\\
The anters are inopportune.\\
