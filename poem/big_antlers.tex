These signals are inopportune\\
Raise your head at a different time\\
I don't need your emotion\\
Not now; maybe something later\\

Your antlers cue envy\\
They tell me I'm downtrodden\\
Yes, I love their fractals\\
But hate why you show them\\

Your antlers are loud horns\\
Songs of mourning\\
Songs I disagree with\\
Bite an apple in the snow please\\

Start and complete a change\\
I'm sick of these hates\\
Bring back smoother heads\\
The antlers are inopportune.\\
