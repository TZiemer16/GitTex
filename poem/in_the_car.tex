In the car\\
With pants on your chest\\
Like a sweater\\
You are sexy\\
Like your surroundings\\
Makeup on the windows\\
Doesn't shine in your eyes\\
You've stilled your momentum\\
You both are together\\
A deadened sensation\\
But that is sex\\
The after care rest\\
on the seats\\
With whoever and\\
whatever plans before\\
This is your home for a second\\
A nap on a bus\\
Or a walk in the park\\
This end is not coming\\
It's an elaborate\\
Of lust\\
Of sexy\\
This is how you dance\\
And I praise you\\
