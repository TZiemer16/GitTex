This is water\\
The female fish said\\
She sung to me\\
blurry and bubbly\\

Never inhale water twice\\
We breath water our\\
wholesome existence\\
Fish die before humans\\

Love sings in water\\
blurry and bubbly\\
Step feet like pound drums\\
Flap lids like shake tree\\

We live in water\\
with sexy fishes\\
and less light\\
water is good\\

But cannot inhale water\\
breath existence\\
or love fishes\\
I say surreptitious repetitions\\
