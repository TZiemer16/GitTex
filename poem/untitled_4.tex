The television show me the end of the world\\
Everyone gets a different channel\\
Galactic clusters collide and fade\\
No camera man\\
Like a baby's mobile, doom spins\\
Really just toys\\
But it's there, it's happening\\
I'm watching it\\
I guess if it's is the end, then I've got nothing else to do\\
It becomes home\\
If you spend 24 hours there, consecutively\\
Yet no one sees what I see\\
Confused signals and stacic-y stares\\
You can scream\\
And try to alert the authorities\\
But no chance\\
This channel is yours, yours alone.\\
