The cat on the wall tells me she sees me\\
with eyes that dangle back and forth\\
it scans mesmerized for signs of life\\
unkempt hairs on my chin radio out for me\\

Martial silence keeps heart beats at bay\\
with every tick of a creepy clock\\
I ask if she is listening, too,
because each of her senses seems misplaced\\

first-apartment cheap wallpaper attracts\\
every eye in the room from the judges decree\\
we cry internally at unfinished business\\
but ignore it to step towards another laugh\\

when I'm tired I think of her pendulum eyes\\
slipping on early Fall icing\\
and what cakes we make, hot boxed car\\
but ignore it to feel like better people\\

dance with me, cat, the slyest of them all\\
disturbed but mostly alive in my mind\\
every step up to your pulpit, when I hear it,\\
is a tapping reminder of the beat of our short song.\\
