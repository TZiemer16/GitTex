In shape\\
My shape\\
Pick a shape\\
Wanna be an apple? ``Pear!''\\
Wanna be a banana? ``Kiwi!''\\
They shout at you to hate you.\\
They aren't the shape they wanna be either\\
Unworth of love\\
because your lipid deposits\\
Your genetics define your body\\
but you define you\\
You could choose to devour water\\
and trim fat\\
But it won't make you happy\\
Pick a shape\\
My shape\\
Your shape\\
This body of yours\\
only needs to spell `love'.\\
