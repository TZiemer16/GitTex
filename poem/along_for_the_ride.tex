When I pinched her arm\\
while dancing\\
she thought it was her ass\\
and felt the need to withdraw\\
Didn't.\\

We stuck together after that\\
never pinched again\\
But we quenched our razors\\
and burned our bras.\\

When she groped me, I had energy\\
Logging no memories\\
Never remembered the mistakes that night\\
we forged on, pitching down the spring.\\
