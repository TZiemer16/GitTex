It's all in my head, I said\\
It's not a big deal\\
Not real, not physical\\
The blood checks out\\
and the hormones are straight\\
``Just a regular old 22''\\
The doctor said\\
I parrot idioms\\
and explain medicine\\
It's just those demons\\
Like monsters under the bed\\

But that's the problem\\
I want to be in my head\\
I didn't think it was vacant\\
It lives here, it's comfortable\\
That's why I need help\\
Because it is in my mind\\
and I wanted to use that\\
I need this brain.\\
