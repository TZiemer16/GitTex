Somewhere Between

Somewhere between\\
``I don't know'' and ``everything''\\
My report to the general\\
My love in green khakis\\
Muster helium shouts\\
Withdrawn behind the helmet\\
My commander wants to know\\
People dead on my battlefield\\
My glasses aren't strong enough\\
He's frustrated and I'm belligerent\\
Followed the tracks\\
Found no sign\\
But no life survives that carraige\\
I tell him I wish I knew\\
But it's just the least reliable captain\\
I saw what happened\\
But I can't say\\
This war\\
Is somewhere between\\
``I don't know'' and ``everything''.\\
