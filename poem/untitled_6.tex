Channels of sprite\\
Lemon lime fills my veins\\
Brings out these pains\\
Electrically trite\\
Losing meaning with each beat\\
Speaking freedoms with each reap\\
Harvest tacky liquid\\
Enjoy seltzer lipid\\
Consume angel wings\\
Affixed to float caffeine\\
with pumping blood benzene\\
while all my tears sings.\\
