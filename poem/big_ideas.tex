Run and sprint and fast and jive \\

Contain? No, I'm taking my swan dive \\

Sugar fueled escapades \\

New friends and old drugs \\

Blast the music; blast the past \\

Memories overwritten \\

Shark fight; knife fight \\

Cannot hold back this hurricane slice \\

Try and bye, hello and I'll die \\

If I stop at all, \\

Stereophonic ball \\

I can do all the dances \\

Rick's puppet, a perfect cadence \\

In a band, in a march, \\

Thrumming on into the night \\

Can't stop like Keidis \\

I'll drive to a high five \\

This energy unquenched \\

I'll be happy if it doesn't kill me \\
