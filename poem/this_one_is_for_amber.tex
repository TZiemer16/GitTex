In my fantasy\\
I am you\\
When you were young\\
A teenager greedy\\
and excited\\
Hair that pulled down\\
Not to the side\\
A coat with pride\\
Succumbing to dreams\\

I want to eat\\
the unknowns in your past\\
Like you forgot\\
Or wanted to forget\\
I want the hollering\\
in the car\\
and the silence\\
on the sidewalk\\
In America we are\\
together\\
But from time\\
I cannot see me\\
(You)\\

When I become one\\
I ache not for the dropping\\
But for the list of the reborn\\
The satellite of your math book\\
The candle in your basement\\
Places away only by you\\
I want your angry sins\\
Even at cost\\
Even with a price\\
I want to share your youth\\
I want to be envious\\
of the others\\
And pry open that chest\\
on my way to your brain\\

I'm silent\\
After band practice\\
I'm a bird in your sketches\\
And the dirt on your skates\\
In a dream I had\\
again\\
In my memories\\
Fun to suppress\\
I make clear some zagged path\\
To a healing place\\
That I know is not triumph\\
But another death\\
A sacred place\\
Not that I am going to,\\
But that I strive to be\\
Every embarassment is good\\
Every giggle is relief\\
Because it means I would be there\\
Because it means I've learned\\
to wrestle down\\
and tumble down\\
Because this is a precious thing to me\\
And I want to be you\\
