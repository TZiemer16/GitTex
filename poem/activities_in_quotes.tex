You can't pass over mental illness.\\
Sex is only a disease if it's too good.\\
If it hurts going in, it's going to hurt coming out.\\
That applies to both alcohol and anal.\\
Laughing isn't fun at all. It's funny, though.\\
Bending over in your bedroom or for your friends.\\
Abusers love misery.\\
My genitals get sad sometimes.\\
Anger is red.\\
My orgasms make me flinch.\\
I swear there's blue on my hands,\\
somewhere.\\
