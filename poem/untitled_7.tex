Shepherd call me to your flock\\
These big glasses let me see\\
the way the path the truth\\
Crook a staff for my tender neck\\

The giant lenses pierce fire\\
to the field, part of the pack\\
I am who alights the grass\\
Ring of roses around our warmth\\

Crook metal cage around my face\\
I see out, but they\\
The herd see disfigure\\
The man in the robes trusted me\\

Two mistakes\\
Break peace for sunshine\\
Illuminate the path\\
down the mountain to the storm\\
