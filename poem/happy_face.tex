The men edged toward the hole\\
dragging their cocks on narrow glass shard trails\\
high above the Sahara and the Adirondacks\\
on each side.\\

The women posed for paintings\\
with emotional frugality\\
sipping pool water through a straw\\
pitching at the ball game.\\

I shrugged, arms wide open\\
relieving the tension from the journey\\
pitch-black wings carried me\\
drooping but graceful.\\
