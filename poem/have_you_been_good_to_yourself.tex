Have you been good to yourself?

In the woods up north\\
Does the maple flow\\
into your mouth?\\
Or does the drink\\
pour from any of a million taps\\
When the treatment comes down\\
From the docter over your head\\
The white coat will blind you\\
And be irresponsible\\
When you leave the dealership\\
does the car crash?\\
Or does the highway stay clear?\\
In night or old age,\\
in Marianas or Polaris,\\
Will you find the soul\\
of your child\\
Will you reach a dirt table?\\
Or will you live forever.\\
Will you arouse arrogance\\
continually?\\
Just to find that\\
You are good to yourself.\\
