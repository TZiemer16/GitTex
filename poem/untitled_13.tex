My anger pains hurt you more\\
Don't know why they call me afflicted\\
Wedding vows with plus one more\\
Acoustic strings snap alive\\
Hisses guided into boos\\
Transform these problems to religion\\
Dance into comfort always\\
But life doesn't play\\
Music like this has no beats\\
I'm angry at my shame\\
Forget the state I'm in, I always do\\
Drop more rungs\\
Your roof too high\\
Standards too low\\
Bleed me organic one more time\\
And I'll forget my promises\\
I promise.\\
