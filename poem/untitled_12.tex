Iron lines grasp\\
tired eyes\\
Painting pictures through\\
clearing pines\\
Exceeding beating soul\\
binding turmoil\\
To words I see\\
towards the sea\\

When out of rhymes\\
I paint clouds in the sky\\
Puffy letters, wet and meaningful\\
A painter-singer-songwriter\\

Discussed friends go bust\\
Analyze fire drives\\
No room in worlds room\\
for all our plans to bloom\\
wanna love; get shoved\\
look above; anticipated buzz\\
slant brands stare damp\\
when I try, I try, I try.\\
