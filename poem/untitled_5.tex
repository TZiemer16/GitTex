Untitled

When all your paintings are roses\\
and all the paints are pastels\\
Then you can admit to being brighter\\
And then you can find a way to be tighter\\

Where all the skirts are short\\
and everything we blurt is long and kindly\\
Find satan with his makeup on\\
Even they with hate want to be called pretty\\

Whisk the beach sand into a bowl\\
Create your vegan eggs, with smiles\\
Then you can find the easter eggs\\
And then we can blind the master who begs\\

Depression makes happiness whole\\
Happiness makes depression care.\\
