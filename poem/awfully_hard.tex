Awfully Hard

Awfully hard to bear this fruit\\
Lower trembling branches to the trunk\\
Brave fire and traffic\\
When you don't eat the apples I deliver\\

With time and love come many things\\
But more changes that good memories\\
Inspect this relationship and its prisoners\\
To find either a key or a pie made from fruit\\

When you don't want what I want,\\
and I want you,\\
it's awfully hard to be generous\\
your poverty is not just financial\\

I buy my love, still\\
At the farmers market, top dollar\\
Fresh and organic, but on our loaded cart\\
I want too much, and my money is no good\\

Lending and giving, end the same\\
My own destitute love is all to blame.\\
