She slicked lemon detergent\\
on my opening fist\\
to coax out a bit of silence\\
I slipped caffeine past her defences\\
onto her lazy afternoon\\
to match my pride\\
Like a greaseball burger we\\
shimmied wet and close\\
together, disgusting, greedy.\\
The drugs pained us like dances in high heels\\
as we saw a ballet and a blitzkreig\\
before the yolk popped\\
we were candy hormones on that couch.\\
