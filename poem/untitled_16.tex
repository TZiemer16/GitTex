Yellow pages yield rewards\\
for guilty angry men\\
Each of their cards glinting gold\\
into newborn children\\
their hearts empassioned but forgotten\\
with upturned cuff links\\
and lazy eyes\\
drinking the black as proof to investors\\
but with a top at the bottom\\
fire beer breeds new seed\\
stepping on upright stickes through marshes\\
ninjas who are blindfolder for fun\\
and out pours the marsh\\
into my mind as I smile\\
into the waterfall,\\
but oily creases in my hair\\
reveal nothing but a curious obedience.\\
