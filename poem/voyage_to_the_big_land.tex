Making hardships\\
and selling seafarers\\
they are new partisans\\
and create the laundry-wearers\\

Give them the best\\
Better than deserved\\
Never a moments rest\\
the whip was reserved\\

Get `em to the stocks\\
No light; a skin immune\\
None given. In shock.\\
Seeing product without might\\

Vengeful words\\
Bring `em on home\\
Selling paradise for trophies\\
Ending with nothing but bone.\\
