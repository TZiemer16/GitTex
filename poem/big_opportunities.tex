Lights high; trilling in\\
Gears chug gatorade\\
Fluid flies for more\\
Streamlined determined bubbles\\
Swoosh through thought\\
Racing corvettes through\\
Primed canals\\
and explosions in the sky\\

Backdrop of a hundred muscular stallions\\
Burgeoning urgent messages\\
Even internet speeds zip\\
and cannons sound off\\
counting down their gunpowder\\

From trodding to tapping to flickering,\\
from slime to paste to smoothie,\\
from static to crackle to lightning.\\

Thin light brings interstellar motion\\
through harmonies craft\\
Extravagant explorers thrill themselves\\
Shed waste to break atmosphere\\

This thing is definitely on.\\
