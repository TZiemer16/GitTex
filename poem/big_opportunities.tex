Lights, in\\
Gears chug gatorade\\
Fluid flies for more\\
Streamlined thought bubbles\\
Swoosh through throught\\
Racing corvettes through\\
Primed canals\\
Explosions in the sky\\
Backdrop a hundred muscular stallions\\
Burgeoning urgent messages\\
Even internet speeds zip\\
and cannons sound off\\
counting down their gunpowder\\
Like a formula 1 race\\
Trodding to tapping to flickering\\
From slime to paste to smoothie\\
Thin light brings interstellar peace\\
Through harmonies craft\\
Extravagant explores thrill themselves\\
Trilling high and low\\
Skipping as fact as I can\\
Fast form to energy\\
This thing is definitely on\\
