There is a pit missing the cherry\\
the color of valley girl hair\\
with quiet smirks it sneaks\\
down into the strip coal mine\\
that I thought we'd played in\\
it glows sweet in my mind\\
though I picked the stem\\
and all fruits have hearts akin.\\
\newline
Though straitions abound young skin\\
counting in the rings to the first time\\
you know that sometimes I won't care\\
every line is progress, not a scar\\
when burly men glide across the mountain sides\\
Appalachia on a budget\\
they don't see trees, or rivers, or you\\
they reveal bridges, haunts, and parks,\\
things that we needed to betray nature\\
not the vitality already regrowing\\
things we miss but do not love\\
\newline
because their appreciation is taken\\
from their ingenuity and arrogance\\
when properly found, you, as a metaphor for nature\\
are a gift, not a treasure\\
and when discovered, the labor required\\
finds calling through an ignorance of purpose\\
leading away from things missed\\
and towards things found,\\
that is the reaping and the sowing\\
just enough to be kind but not generous\\
and unfair american fruit.\\
